# Datasets Quick Start

> Create your first dataset and import training data.

Datasets are the raw material for training models. They're where you'll go to collect, evaluate, and refine your training data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Dataset">
    To create a dataset, navigate to the **Datasets** tab and click **New Dataset**.

    Your dataset will be given a default name including the time at which it was created. We suggest editing the name to something more descriptive.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Data">
    Now that you have a shiny new dataset, you need to somehow import data into it. This can be done in one of two ways:

    1. [Importing request logs](/features/datasets/importing-logs)
    2. [Uploading a file from your machine](/features/datasets/uploading-data)
